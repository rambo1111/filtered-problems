        Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.
        Description:
        The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.
        A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.
        The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift’s activities.
        Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.
        Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.
        This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.
        Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. 
        Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. 
        Possible Solution:
        An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.
        Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</td>

        Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.
        Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.
        
        • Description:
        The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further
        investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.
        Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:
        1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
        2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
        3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
        4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)
        There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.
        For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:
        1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.
        2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).
        3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).
        4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.
        5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.
        A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.
        
        Expected Solution:
        A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools
        should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.</td>

                    <td>Background: The impact of oil spills at sea is multifaceted, affecting the environment, economy, public health, and society at large. Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. 
        Detailed description: 
        The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. 
        To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently. As far as study area, any of the below options may be considered.

        Expected solution: Automated oil spill detection system for early detection of oil spills
        A software/tool/system to be developed for detecting oil spills/vessel in distress with suitable methodology that involves programming in python. The tool/system should detect the anomalies in AIS around the vessel. The distress/anomaly zone has to be monitored for oil spills using Satellite datasets. This can help in early detection of oil leak from a ship or vessel. The information can be passed on to the regulatory authorities for quicker and efficient response.</td>

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.
        Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship’s motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.
        Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.
        The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.
        It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.
        Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.
        Expected Solution:
        Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.

                    <td>Background: Synthetically-generated audios and videos i.e. deep fakes are in trends nowadays. Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation’s politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.
        Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: 
        i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. 
        ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. 
        iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. 
        iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. 
        v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. 
        vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. 
        vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. 
        viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. 
        ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. 
        Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation.</td>

        The absence of a centralized knowledge-sharing platform like wikis significantly hampers the dissemination of water-efficient techniques, which could mitigate water scarcity. Despite the existence of various methods to conserve water, especially in agriculture, the lack of awareness and accessibility to this information perpetuates inefficient water use. This gap in knowledge sharing contributes to the overuse of water resources and exacerbates water stress, particularly in regions where agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation. Establishing a comprehensive, accessible platform could catalyze the adoption of sustainable practices, crucial for addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. 
        Detailed Description: 
        A centralized knowledge-sharing platform akin to Wikis would facilitate the exchange of innovative methods, successful case studies, and research findings, fostering local and global collaboration. Without it, valuable insights remain siloed, hindering the adoption of practices that could conserve water resources and enhance sustainability. The creation of an accessible, comprehensive repository of water conservation strategies is thus critical for addressing the pressing challenge of water scarcity worldwide. 
        Expected Solution: 
        To address the lack of knowledge sharing platforms on water efficiency, creating a dedicated wiki-style database is the key. This platform would host peer-reviewed articles on water-saving techniques, community forums for sharing local knowledge, videos and interactive tools for calculating water usage and savings. Additionally, integrating social media sharing can amplify reach and engagement, while mobile app development ensures accessibility for users in remote areas, contributing significantly to the reduction of water scarcity globally.</td>

        Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. 
        Description 
        There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. 
        Expected Solution 
        There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</td>

                    <td>Background: With a view to address the issue of faster resolution of commercial disputes and for fostering a conducive environment for ease of doing business in India, the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted to provide for setting up of commercial courts. Over the years, various legislative and policy reforms have been undertaken by the Government of India with the active support of the judiciary to strengthen the commercial
        dispute resolution machinery in the country. However, expediting the resolution of commercial disputes without addressing the broader issue of huge pendency in courts is unlikely to be successful. Accordingly, it is proposed to leverage the use of technology for expediting the process of dispute resolution.
        ? Description: A solution is invited to develop an AI-Driven Research Engine exclusively for commercial courts thereby easing the legal research process for judges and judicial officers ultimately contributing to faster dispute resolution.
        o Role: The Research Engine must aggregate and process legal data sources, including case laws, statutory provisions, rules, etc. After aggregation and processing of data, it must extract relevant information, identify key legal principles, precedents, etc. and furnish results.
        o Customization: The Research Engine must provide results in a customized manner i.e. as per the needs and demands of each commercial suit.
        o Use of Predictive Analytics: The Research Engine must be capable of forecasting case outcomes based on historical trends and patterns.
        o Data Localization: The Research Engine must ensure that the results meet the diverse requirements of different High Courts of the country and that adequate emphasis is laid on local laws, rules and procedures.
        o Feasibility: The solution must be technically feasible as per the requirements of the Indian Judicial System.
        o Reliability: The Research Engine must ensure that the results are relevant and reliable.
        o User-Friendly: The Research Engine must be user-friendly.
        o Multilingual: The Research Engine must ensure that it supports multiple languages.
        o Ethical Concerns: Giving primacy to ethical concerns surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, measures must be taken to ensure that the engine works in a neutral and transparent manner as a ‘facilitator’ and not a ‘decision-maker’.
        ? Expected Solution: Development of an “Artificial Intelligence-Driven Research Engine for Commercial Courts” that may be considered for a pilot project for reforms associated with commercial courts with the ultimate objective of ease of doing business in India. The solution is expected to assist in expediting legal research and streamlining judicial processes.</td>

                    <td>Background
        1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out
        plans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources.
        2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP’s core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people’s needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision.
        3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance.
        The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution.
        4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas.
        Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society Approach’ and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India.

        Description
        Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development
        The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the
        
        village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ‘Farmville’ kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.
        Key Components to include for the game app:
        Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning.
        Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc.
        The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: -
        i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers.
        ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required.
        iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village.
        iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of
        drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc.
        v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity
        as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats.
        vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features.
        vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed.
        viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform.
        ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.
        A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: -
        Case1: Road laying activity
        
        • The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction plan.
        • The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on
        changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated.
        • Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated.
        • Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders.
        
        Case 2: Streetlight
        
        • The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts.
        • The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change – the changes to reflect on the game for best results.
        • Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated.
        
        Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side.
        
        • The player selects the village for developmental activity.
        • The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village.
        • The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area.
        
        Expected Solution
        Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times, exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to
        develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat development plan activities.
        • A detailed game outlining the work model.
        • Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface.
        • Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification system into the Hackathon event.

        Description: This problem statement addresses the urgent requirement for an online platform, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, to automate document verification for all official purposes. The proposed solution aims to establish a user-friendly portal accessible to issuing authorities (e.g., schools, universities, employers), verifying authorities (government offices, banks, legal entities), and individuals. Issuing authorities will generate digital certificates for individuals, including birth certificates, academic transcripts, and experience certificates. These certificates will be securely stored on the blockchain for tamper-proof authenticity. Individuals will have access to the portal to view all documents issued in their name.
        
        Expected Solution: Participants are tasked with developing a comprehensive portal that facilitates the generation, verification, and accessibility of essential documents for any official purpose. The platform should utilize Al algorithms to efficiently verify the authenticity of uploaded documents. Verifying authorities will have access to a secure interface to validate submitted documents against predefined criteria. Individuals will be able to access the portal to view all documents issued to their name. The implementation of blockchain technology will ensure the immutability and integrity of the verified certificates. Ultimately, the solution aims to streamline the document verification process, reducing time and resources required for all stakeholders involved in official documentation.</td>

                    <td>As the global shift towards renewable energy intensifies, solar trackers, which adjust solar panels to follow the sun’s path, are crucial for maximizing solar energy efficiency. Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun’s trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and Simulink®, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using Simulink® Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.
